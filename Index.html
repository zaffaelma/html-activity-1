    <p>In the last decade, the area of artificial intelligence (AI) has exploded with<br>
      interesting and promising results. With major achievements in image<br>
      recognition, speech recognition and highly complex games, AI continues to<br>
      disrupt society. This blog post will discuss practical applications of AI,<br>
      optimization and interpretability of deep learning models and<br>
      reinforcement learning (RL), based on the <u>2018 REWORK Deep Learning<br>
      Summit</u> in Toronto. Four software engineers from Knowit had the pleasure<br>
      of travelling to Canada to attend this conference, and with renowned<br>
      speakers such as Geoff Hinton attending, it turned out be an insightful<br>
      experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Practical Predictions and Application of AI</h2>
    
    <p>Early AI revolved around perceiving, deciding and acting. Today, the<br>
      addition of learning is also in place, but due to the non-deterministic nature<br>
      of the real world, decisions cannot be made purely from the facts that are<br>
      given. Further development of AI will require improvements in a variety of<br>
      areas. Andrew W. Moore, Dean of the School of Computer Science at<br>
      Carnegie Mellon, shared his thoughts on what he thinks will be important.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Firstly, game theory provides an improvement to the decision making<br>
      capabilities of an AI model, as the most probable answer is not always the<br>
      correct answer. This can be explained from his example of an AI trying to<br>
      predict the whereabouts of poachers in a national park. At first, the AI<br>
      performed well at predicting the location of poachers, however, after a while<br>
      the poachers in the national park learned from this and went to less obvious<br>
      locations. As a result of this, the AI degenerated in performance. To improve<br>
      the AI, game theory was introduced. By viewing the poachers as other<br>
      players in a game, the AI was able to predict where the poachers were<br>
      located even though they were not necessarily located at the optimal<br>
      locations.</p>

    <p>Secondly, autonomous AI is much researched these days. This enables, e.g.,<br>
      smaller robots to work together to solve a larger problem, in addition self-<br>
      optimizing code, which means that the efficiency of an algorithm written by<br>
      a human can be improved by an AI. These are only a few of the possibilities<br>
      with more autonomous AI.</p>

    <p>As <u>presented</u> by Tzvi Aviv, Founder & CEO at AgriLogicAI, AI can lead<br>
      to major improvements in the agriculture and food sector. In his presentation<br>
      he showed that AI can be used in conjunction with geospatial data to<br>
      increase productivity, profitability and sustainability in the agriculture and<br>
      food sector. By using remote sensing yield performance of soy varieties, soil<br>
      data, weather data and genetic data of soy varieties, AgriLogicAi created an<br>
      Ensemble of Cubist model, <u>a type of rule-based model</u>, model which<br>
      projected a 5% increase in soy yields by optimizing the selected soy variety<br>
      given an area. This and other innovations to the agricultural food industry<br>
      will become more and more important as we are facing a difficult time<br>
      ahead with more challenging weather conditions.<br>
    </p>

    <p>Nargiz Mammadova, founder & CEO at <u>Destin AI</u>, talked about the use of AI<br>
      immigration. To settle down in a new country you would have to fill out<br>
      many forms and be approved for citizenship through various applications.<br>
      Yet, before the actual application process, you would have to navigate<br>
      through the bureaucratic process of identifying and localizing these<br>
      applications. This is where AI could be helpful, exemplified by the AI<br>
      assistant Destin AI are currently working on, which can provide and<br>
      effective interface for users to interact with. The involvement of RPA<br>
      together with an AI-powered platform could potentially decrease refusal rate<br>
      and repetitive admin work, in addition to boosting the efficiency and<br>
      accuracy of information to the user. Furthermore, it could increase the<br>
      number of applications, approval rate and the speed of the application<br>
      process. Mammadova also presented the possibility of predicting the<br>
      outcome of an application and identifying reasons for approval and<br>
      rejection. As a result, the application reviewers can use more time on the<br>
      applications that are difficult and require more time to assess.<br>
    </p>

    <p>Brendan Frey, Co-Founder, CEO at Deep Genomics and Professor at the<br>
      University of Toronto, provided an insight to AI in the pharmaceutical<br>
      He pointed out that 65% of all people will be affected by a genetic<br>
      disease over a lifetime and health budgets in most countries are extremely<br>
      high. In combination with a rapidly decreasing internal rate of return for<br>
      research and development in the pharmaceutical industry, the old way of<br>
      discovering new drugs is broken. AI needs to be further explored in this field<br>
      and, as mentioned in his <u>paper</u>, can most certainly help with this by aiding<br>
      in finding new drugs and personalize treatment according a person’s<br>
      genome. With the human genome mapped and the large amount of datasets<br>
      available, training sequence models capable of discovering genes with<br>
      unfavourable traits and mutations is not far from reality.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Optimization and Robustness of Deep Learning</h2>
    <p>Another big topic in the future of AI is optimization of deep learning and<br>
      how to make deep neural networks more robust. A known example of how<br>
      fragile neural networks can be, is this adversarial demonstration from<br>
      <u>Explaining and Harvesting Adversarial Examples:</u><br>
    </p>

    <img src="img2.webp" width="550px"/>

    <p>In this example the network can detect the panda in the image to the left.<br>
      Now, if you alter that picture by adding a toned down image of noise with<br>
      gibbon-like features, the network will classify the image as a gibbon.<br>
      However, to the human eye the picture has not been altered at all.<br>
    </p>

    <p>Researchers at McGill University are trying to address this by using Lipschitz<br>
      regularization while performing adversarial training as presented at the<br>
      REWORK deep learning summit Toronto 2018. The Lipschitz constant<br>
      measures the amplification factor of a perturbation, and by adding this to<br>
      the loss function during training of a neural network, one can improve the<br>
      adversarial attack robustness with a significant amount.<br>
    </p>

    <p>Another challenge for AI is processing power. In the future we want the<br>
      machine learning models to run on embedded devices such as phones and<br>
      in cars, but the amount of processing power currently present in these<br>
      devices are not on the same level as computers. Snapchat uses neural<br>
      networks in their filters, and are working on making these networks<br>
      runnable on your phone. One way Snapchat is trying to solve this issue is by<br>
      model compression; how can we keep the high accuracy, but lower the<br>
      computational complexity? Their idea is to use weight sampling, as<br>
      convolutional filters are, in their words, highly redundant. Snapchat has<br>
      developed new features, allowing 5x3 (15) weights be condensed to 7<br>
      weights, thereby reducing the memory usage by more than 50%.<br>
      </p>

    <p>The University of Guelph (UoG) are also working on deep learning<br>
      optimization. ML practitioners often assume they have a 32-bit floating point<br>
      data type easily accessible. However, by using lower precision one can<br>
      greatly increase speed and memory advantages. Researchers from UoG are<br>
      working on methods to train networks with binary weights and activations at<br>
      run time. In addition to memory advantages and higher speed, they report<br>
      that the binary networks are also more resistant to adversarial attacks!<br>
    </p>

    <p>An older <u>paper</u> (2015) from Geoffrey Hinton also touches upon optimization<br>
      of deep learning by distilling the knowledge from an ensemble of models<br>
      into a single model, thus reducing the need for multiple models and<br>
      memory. Maybe this can minimize the need of processing power in the<br>
      future?<br>
